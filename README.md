We started with 11 independent variables. We performed a backwords slection algoritm resulting in a final model 
using 3 variables: obesity, drinking, and medium household income. We created a log-linear model. Increases in the 
independent variables resulted in a predicted percent change in depression rate.
Obesity and binge drinking had a positive coefficent, household income had a negative coefficient.
The F statistic indicates the model is useful, with an Adjusted R-quared value of .647.
